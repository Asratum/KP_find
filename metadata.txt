name=KP Find
qgisMinimumVersion=3.20
description=Finds geodetic distance along and to the side of a line
version=3.2.0
author=Milen Iliev
email=m.iliev@posteo.de

about=
	Measures geodetic distance along a line, i.e. the chainage (in KP - kilometer points) and offset. 
	Clicking copies the information to the clipboard. Can generate chainage points, geodetic and cartesian.
	Can also make a copy of a point layer with new attributes for KP and distance-off-line (DOL), Lat and Lon.
	Please note: perpendicularity changes with each CRS and the distortions it creates - the chainage points are
	those perpendicular in the CRS of the line layer.
	If more than one feature in the line layer is present, the user will be prompted to choose one by feature ID.
