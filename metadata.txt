qgisMinimumVersion=3.0
description=Finds geodetic distance along and to the side of a line
version=3.1.0
author=Milen Iliev
email=m.iliev@posteo.de

about=
	Measures geodetic distance along a line, i.e. the chainage (in KP - kilometer points) and offset. 
	Clicking copies the information to the clipboard. Can generate chainage points, geodetic and cartesian.
	Can also make a copy of a point layer with new attributes for KP and DOL, Lat and Lon.
	Please note: the plugin only accepts layers with the same CRS. It takes the first feature in the line layer - 
	it is best if the line layer has only one feature, but the plugin will issue a warning if not the case.
	Code borrowed from the Lat Lon Tools, Shapetools and Closest Point plugins.
	Reliable results only with projected layers!
